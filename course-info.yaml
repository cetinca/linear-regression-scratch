title: Linear Regression from Scratch
language: English
summary: <p>Linear relationship estimation is probably the first kind of modeling
  we come across at school. Linear regression is one of the most popular methods for
  estimating linear relationships and one of the most popular machine learning algorithms.
  This project explains how the linear regression algorithm works. These basics will
  help you with model interpretation and debugging if you want to fit and predict
  linear models.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/195?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/195</a>
